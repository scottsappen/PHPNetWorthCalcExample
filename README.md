# PHPNetWorthCalcExample
Simple net worth calculator written in PHP and integrated with WordPress, ReCaptcha and a 2nd standalone MySQL DB.

I did this for a number of reasons:
- I wanted to see why people love PHP so much
- I wanted to see how easy it was to leverage WordPress APIs and do something meaningful
- I wanted to see how easy it is to integrate a 2nd standalone MySQL database
- I wanted to do something non-trivial with JavaScript

In some ways, I wish I wasn't so curious about various tech because I could have spent those hours watching the tube. :)
